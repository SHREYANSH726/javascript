// Explain the difference between the data types String and Number in JavaScript. Provide an example of each.


// String
// A String is used to represent textual data. It is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes ("),
// or template literals (backticks, `). Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

let name = "John Doe";  // This is a string



// Number
// A Number represents both integers and floating-point numbers. Numbers do not have quotation marks around them. 
// They can be used in mathematical operations and represent values such as whole numbers or decimals.
let num1 = 5; // Number
